# Machine Coding Round

## Alert Monitor
Consider a microservice env where several systems use one central system for all their alert use
cases: Design and implement a system which can capture events generated by any system or
user triggered (for simplicity), and raise an alert according to alert configuration.

## Project Structure
The Main acts as an entry point. In the main we create a MonitoringService object. Using this object we add different client configurations. This object is used to process the incoming events as well and raise alerts if there is a threshold breach.

### MonitoringService
MonitoringService exposes methods for adding client configurations and processing events.

### AlertingService
This package contains all the classes/interfaces required for processing alerts.

### DispatchService
This package contains all the classes/interfaces required for dispatching an alert.
